There are 4 states with available data and can be downloaded from this link: [Caselaw Access Project/Bulk Data](https://case.law/bulk/download/)

## Techniques

We should pick up three to four techniques to try.
 **Do we have enough time to try several?**
  Yeah I think 3 and 4 are difficult and unlikely to yield good results. We could do it as a trial and say we wanted to test out how good a first attempt is.

 1. Extractive summarization using classification
 1. Unsupervised learning using Page rank
 3. Seq2Seq
 4. Transofrmers

## Task List:

 - [x] First Task (name)
 - [ ] Second Task  (name)
 - [ ] Third Task (name)

## Open Questions:

 - Where are headnotes in the dataset?
 - Why are there more headnotes than cases? _Headnotes are summaries of legal principles which each case have many. Lawyers use headnotes as shortcuts for looking for legal principles to use and what other cases have similar headnotes_
